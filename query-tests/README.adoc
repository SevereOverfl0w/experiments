= Asciidoctor clojure test result inclusion
:source-highlighter: coderay

A little utility to enable including clojure test results into produced
documents.

== Usage

Create some clojure.tests as normal, but add the metadata `:document-me` to
enable collection of the results:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns myproject.test.sample
  (:require [clojure.test :as t]))

(t/deftest ^:document-me
  some-test
  (t/is (= 4 (+ 2 3)))
  (t/is (= 4 (+ 2 2))))
----

The above tests will create output like:

[source,clojure]
----
=> (+ 2 3) ;; Doesn't produce:
4

=> (+ 2 2)
4
----

=== With asciidoctor

You can then create asciidoctor files in the `src` directory, which can utilize
these test results.

To collect the results of a test, use the uri-like notation `cljtest://`
followed by the var without `#'`. In the above example, this would be:
`cljtest://myproject.test.sample/some-test` for example.

You can create HTML of your asciidoc files like so:

[source, shell]
----
$ boot go target
----

Which will place the produced html into `target` for your convenient opening.

Included in the repo is a sample adoc file, which will be available like so:

[source, shell]
----
$ ${BROWSER:firefox} target/README-SOURCE.html
----
